<b><head>Terminator List, by Quang Hoang</b>

</font>

<font color="0000ff">

<details><i><p>This is a Terminator List made by me. This Terminator List is made for the purpose of describing
the Terminators in my own definition. All Terminators mentioned are androids, except the T-X, which is a gynoid,
and the T-3000, which is a cyborg. We'll talk about them later. Anyways, there are five Terminator movies out 
there. 1) The Terminator (1984) 2) Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) 3) Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003)
4) Terminator Salvation (2009) 5) Terminator Genisys (2015). This is all the movies that came out so far. I hope to see
some more Terminator movies. Let's start with the one and only, the T-800.</p></i></details>

<h1>T-800</h1>

<img src="trjs67656.jpg" width=150 height=100 alt="T-800">

The T-800 is one of the best known Terminators out there. The full name of the T-800 is The Cyberdyne Systems Series 800 Terminator.
This type of Terminator was produced by Skynet, a highly advanced artificial intelligence that grew self-aware.
The T-800 was the first cybernetic organism that had living tissue over a hyperalloy endoskeleton. This was revolutionary to Skynet,
as it was a successful Infiltrator unit, capable of infiltrating the Human Resistance. The T-800 was the first Terminator of its series,
as the T-850 and the T-888 came along. The CPU of the T-800 was called a Neural Net Processor CPU, also known as a "learning computer".
It is one of the most powerful microprocessors ever built, as it can think and learn for itself.
All Terminators above the 800 series have this specific CPU, except the T-3000, which we'll talk about later.
It can also impersonate other people, meaning it can act like one guy but isn't that guy. Your lucky if you find this Terminator
friendly, or else!

<h2>T-1000</h2>

<font color="#ff0000">

<img src="t-1000_002.png" width=150 height=100 alt="T-1000">

The T-1000 Advanced Prototype, or the T-1000, was produced by Skynet in 2029. This is the first Terminator in the 1000 series, and it is fully autonomous.
Unlike the previous Infiltrator models, who used rubber skin, the T-1000 is unique, as it is purely made of liquid metal called "mimetic polyalloy".
This means it can change into anything it touches, as long as that thing it touches is solid and the Terminator's approximate size. This Terminator
is also known as a "shape-changer". Like the 800 series, it can impersonate other people. This Terminator can also morph its arms into
sharp blades. To sum it all up, it is basically invulnerable. You better watch out if you meet this guy!

<h3>T-850</h3>

<font color="#ff0000">

<img src="terminator_robot.jpg" width=150 height=100 alt="T-850">

The T-850, or the Cyber Research Systems Series 850 Terminator, is part of the 800 series and mass produced by Skynet.
The T-850 is an upgrade to the T-800. The purpose of this creation was the fact that they were losing to the Human Resistance
as the future war progressed. The Resistance got more and more plasma weapons from fallen units, and captured factories and
warehouses, and were used as bases. So the T-850 was designed to be more tougher against plasma attacks and was added new things to help
Skynet win the war. This Terminator was made in 2027. The parts of the Terminator were upgraded by a lot. They had stronger
endoskeletons, tougher joints and hydraulics, better power cells, and lots more. Considering the upgraded things listed, the
T-850 is more powerful than its predecessor. The T-850's flesh is much more easier to remove than the T-800 so the T-850
can make internal repairs easier. The T-850 was programmed to destroy the Resistances' defenses or any reprogrammed Terminators.
If the skin or flesh is ripped off or damaged, they can easily be recovered or reformed, in case infiltration is needed
in the future. The T-850 weighs about 200 kilograms, and the endoskeleton is much better than its predecessor.
Of course, the T-850's armor and strength was improved from the T-800. Also, the T-850 has two hydrogen fuel cells
unlike the previous Terminators. This supports the Terminator for better power and a longer life. This cell replaces
nuclear-energy Iridium cell from the T-800. The reason for two hydrogen fuel cells is 1) better power and longer life
and 2) in case one fuel cell is on fire/poisoned/etc. The T-850 can still operate on one hydrogen fuel cell, although
it won't be as fast or strong as before. Well, that wraps up my research on the T-850. If you encounter it, you better be armed!

<h4>T-X</h4>

<font color="#ff0000">

<img src="t-xii.jpg" width=150 height=100 alt="T-X">

The Cyber Research Systems Model T-X, or T-X Terminatrix for short, is an upgraded model succeeding the T-950 and its past Terminators.
The T-X was produced by Skynet in an alternated timeline. The purpose of this creation was to destroy John Connor, a future Human Resistance
Leader. Since the 1000 series used mimetic polyalloy, Skynet used that substance again for the T-X, but instead combined it with an
advanced endoskeleton, which was from the T-900. Since this was the latest Terminator of its time, it was more superior in most ways when
compared to the previous Terminators. On the downside, they lack some things from the T-800, as they lack the ability to sweat, bleed, and
living tissue. However, that downside could also be useful for their shape-shifting ability. Since the T-X series has a lot of prototypes
in it, the Terminator is heavy, weighing approximately 330.6 pounds. What makes it even more powerful is that the T-X is protected by malleable,
crystalline, and ceramic armor filled with carbon and titanium. That means she is literally unstoppable on the battlefield, even more tougher
than the T-1000. It is extremely strong and fast, and can move joints in ways that no human can do. The T-X has artificial liquid steel
lubrication. Each joint has a really high degree of rotation. The neck can even rotate 360 degrees! This is by far the most superior in all
of its previous Terminators mentioned and not mentioned. What's even more dangerous about the T-X is that it has a onboard weapons systems,
the first Infiltrator class to have weapons built into it. It has a strong internal arsenal, and the T-X possesses
the ability to have many different weapons and tools. One of the weapons and tools are the flamethrower and the plasma cannon. And hey,
I said in the beginning that the T-X was a gynoid, right. A gynoid is basically an android, a robot with a human appearance, except the fact
that a gynoid is a female android. The suffix "andr-" means "man" in the masculine gendered sense. I am now done talking about that Terminatrix.
If you ever bump into it... I don't even need an explanation for this...

<h5>T-3000</h5>

<font color="#ff0000">

<img src="tg-johnconnorcyborg-poster.jpg" width=150 height=100 alt="T-3000, John Connor">

Ah yes, we have all been waiting for this Terminator, am I right? Anyways, this Terminator, also known as the Prototype Series 3000 Terminator, 
should never be confused with the Terminator 3000, because that is another project Skynet was working on. Anyways, wonder why
there was only one T-3000 in the first five movies, and appeared in the fifth movie? We'll tell about that later, but let's get to the important
facts first. The T-3000 is a superior battle unit made by Skynet. The T-3000 is an extremely advanced model who arrived in the fifth movie of the
Terminator franchise. The T-3000 is considered the most prime Terminator ever in creation. So anyways, units of T-3000 were humans who was
transformed through exposure to a type of machine phase matter. This would rewrite the unit's genetic coding, forcing the body to be turned into
resin at a cellular level. All of the people exposed to the phase matter were driven crazy and died during the experimental age. However, in the
fifth movie, John Connor was infected by a <a href="http://terminator.wikia.com/wiki/T-5000">T-5000</a> and transformed successfully into a T-3000.
He was the only known, successful example of the T-3000. This basically shows how courageous and strong John Connor was, as he was tough enough to 
not go insane. So, why was John Connor a cyborg when he turned into a T-3000. It is because of the body development. It is entirely formed by the
nanites of its phase matter, and the machine phase matter that forms the T-3000's chassis is held together by a magnetic field that could be further
be operated into developing stabbing weapons and granting the individual reformation and impersonation abilities equivalent to those Series with
mimetic polyalloy (Series 1000, Series etc.) It can absorb incoming fire and explosive damage better than previous series and reconstructs quicker
than even a T-1000 could; however, it doesn't have the ability to split a part of itself to serve in role as a tracking device nor an independent
sub unit. This unit can weaken  its magnetic connections momentarily in order to reassemble elsewhere at frightening speeds, even to the point of
phasing through solid objects, giving the T-3000 enhanced hand-to-hand combat and other abilities. The T-3000 can also use its magnetic field to 
walk along metal surfaces, such as walking up a vertical surface. It is also capable of learning via touch, such as determining security codes
while impaling the user of those codes. So, if you are looking to hack codes, look for any T-3000. In addition, the T-3000 is immune to
electrocution, as like I said, is entirely formed by the nanites of its phase matter. In full combat mode, the T-3000 displays superior
physical strength, being powerful enough to fully lift a T-800 one-handed and throw it at a significant distance without requiring momentum
of leverage. It is also incredibly fast, capable of phasing through attacks and can deliver eight rapid punches in a single second. It possesses
extreme invulnerability to physical attacks, making it invulnerable to bullets, explosions, fire, electrocution, water, etc. However, it can be
penetrated by something as strong as another Terminator, but its cells immediately reform afterwards and it regains its mobility in half the time,
regarless of the injury. The T-3000 can retain its human base form, but given a strong magnetic bond ensures the robotic cells retain together,
they always return to the shape of a human body. If you meet John Connor, you better run away IMMEDIATELY, because he gives no mercy at all...

<h6>T-5000</h6>

<font color="#ff0000">

<img src="tg-alex-promo-ew-1.jpg" width=150 height=100 alt="T-5000, Alex, Skynet">

The T-5000 is an advanced model in the Terminator series produced by Skynet in 2029 during the period shortly before the final battle. The T-5000,
or Alex, or Skynet, and T-3000 both use nanorobotics in a similar shapeshifting capacity as the T-1000; however, they are not liquid metal nanobots.
The T-5000 has the ability to 'convert' a living organism into a nanorobotic Terminator like itself, at the cellular level. The new Terminator
keeps the appearance of its organic form and retains its host's memories and behavioral characteristics. Anyways, back to the beginning of the
sentence, it was directly observed that, during the final confrontation, Skynet itself transferred its consciousness into a T-5000 unit to survive
and infect John Connor, before turning him into a T-3000 and killing his squad from Tech-Com. The T-5000 possesses the ability to infect human beings
with nano-robots which recode human DNA at the cellular level, transforming them into T-3000 cyborgs. Skynet, also known as...Alex, transformed
himself into a T-5000 to infect John Connor and win the war and recreate Judgment Day. Since Alex easily infiltrated John Connor's Tech-Com unit,
it is likely that the T-5000 cannot be detected by dogs (which were often used to detect covert Terminators, due to the canines' enchanced olfactory
senses) since most of the Resistance units have dogs in the base. Alex still has emotions, but human-like emotions, Skynet's core is still conscious,
and he can transform any human into a T-3000. He targets John Connor as a victim of the T-3000 and its status is still active. And also, since the
only known T-5000 unit so far was only briefly feature in Terminator Genisys, its combat abilities are largely unknown, however, it seemingly easily
overpowered John Connor's elite squad of soldiers without sustaning any serious damage. John Connor's squad is extremely well equipped and trained,
therefore very formidable, able to take down very powerful Terminators. This feat of combat skill likely makes the T-5000 one of the most powerful,
if not the most powerful Terminator in existence so far...
